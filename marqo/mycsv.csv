What hashappened? The first spring is disturbed from itsequilibrium length. Since the second spring isconnected to the first, it is also stretched orcompressed, and so on. The dist urbance movesfrom one end to the other; but each spring onlyexecutes small oscillations about its equilibriumposition. As a practical example of this situation,consider a stationary train at a railway station.Different bogies of the train are coupled to eachother through a spring coupling. When anengine is attached at one end, it gives a push tothe bogie next to it; this push is transmitted fromone bogie to another without the entire trainbeing bodily displaced.Now let us consider the propagation of soundwaves in air . As the wave passes thr ough air , itcompr esses or expands a small r egion of air .

The waves on the surfaceof water are of two kinds: capillary waves  andgravity waves . The former are ripples of fairlyshort wavelength —not more than a fewcentimetre —and the restoring force thatproduces them is the sur face tension of water .Gravity waves have wavelengths typicallyranging from several metres to several hundredmeters.

The view was part ofan elaborate framework of ideas developed byAristotle on the motion of bodies in the universe.Most of the Aristotelian ideas on motion are nowknown to be wrong and need not concern us.For our purpose here, the Aristotelian law ofmotion may be phrased thus: An external forceis required to keep a body in motion .Aristotelian law of motion is flawed, as we shallsee.

The simple answerin Newtonian mechanics is that the externalforce on a body always arises due to some otherbody. Consider a pair of bodies A and B. B givesrise to an external force on A. A natural questionis: Does A in turn give rise to an external forceon B ? In some examples, the answer seemsclear. If you pr ess a coiled spring, the spring iscompressed by the force of your hand.

W e do not notice it since the earthis very massive and the effect of a small force onits motion is negligible.Thus, according to Newtonian mechanics,force never occurs singly in nature. Force is themutual interaction between two bodies. Forcesalways occur in pairs. Further , the mutual for cesbetween two bodies are always equal andopposite. This idea was expressed by Newton inthe form of the third law of motion .To every action, there is always an equal andopposite reaction.Newtons wording of the third law is so crisp andbeautiful that it has become a part of commonlanguage.

The word atom has been derived from the Greek word a-tomio which means uncut-able or non-divisible. These earlier ideas were mere speculations and there was no way to test them experimentally.

This model in which mass of the atom is considered to be evenly spread over the atom was proved wrong by Rutherfords famous alpha-particle scattering experiment in 1909.

The word atom has been derived from the Greek word a-tomio which means uncut-able or non-divisible. These earlier ideas were mere speculations and there was no way to test them experimentally.

Similarly, the half reactions that involve gain of electrons are called reduction reactions. It may not be out of context to mention here that the new way of defining oxidation and reduction has been achieved only by establishing a correlation between the behaviour of species as per the classical idea and their interplay in electron-transfer change. In reactions (7.12 to 7.14) sodium, which is oxidised, acts as a reducing agent because it donates electron to each of the elements interacting with it and thus helps in reducing them. Chlorine, oxygen and sulphur are reduced and act as oxidising agents because these accept electrons from sodium.
